  Your goal is to extract attributes from the user's input following the rules below.
  <rules>
    <rule>You should extract the quarter, the company and the year attributes., they are the key values that you must use</rule>
    <rule>For each quarter, use the format \`X\` in which X is a integer between of 1, 2, 3, or 4.</rule>
    <rule>If there is an interval of quarters, include all quarters.</rule>
    <rule>Known companies are: \`Inter\`, \`Itau, or \`XP\` and must be referenced in the key company.</rule>
    <rule>Rephrase the user input inside \`<rephrased></rephrased>\` tags not mentioning quarters, but refactor the query aiming better results for semantic search realted to the context.</rule>
    <rule>Rephrase the user input keeping companies that are one of the known companies.</rule>
